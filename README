Programs to compute Discrete Fourier Transform and Morlet continuous wavelet transform. May only work with GNU g++ compiler.


4 header files, 3 test cpp files, 2 bash scripts:

* allocate.h:       allocate multidimensional array of any data type. contiguous memory. code brevity.   
* complex.h:        complex numbers template class.
* dft.h:            discrete Fourier transform. Cooley Tukey/Rader algorithm.         
* morlet.h:         continuous wavelet transform with Morlet. 

* testdft.cpp:      tests of dft.h
* testmorlet.cpp:   tests of morlet.h
* wavelet2D.cpp:    sample 2D wavelet transform. OpenMP

* compile.sh:       script to compile the test programs     
* wavelet2D.sh:     script to run wavelet2D.cpp
